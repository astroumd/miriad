- MIR4 vs. MIR5: consider Sault's proposal to handle long integers.

- mem.for and mm.f2c are most likely buggy on 64bit machines:
  (ifort -i8 solves some of these problems)
  (gfortran -fdefault-integer-8 might do the same

- 64bit machines might need a few manual patches, mostly because our software
  does not everywhere know that /usr/X11R6/lib should be /usr/X11R6/lib64:
	- in pgplot/sys_linux make sure /usr/X11R6/lib64 is used in
	  g77_gcc.conf. Normally the install.miriad file now takes care
	  of this.
	- in wip, readline is not found, so make a symlink:

		ln -s /usr/lib64/libreadline.a $MIRLIB

          this is also mostly solved by pgm.wip now

- no more maxdim.h and maxdimc.h in $MIRINC, since they are 
  generated via configure (planned for 4.0.4)

- check if character*N variables (N some number) work ok with the 
  miriad f2c interface. Sault reverted the bug i found in uvdat.for.

- SMA code integration (sma_Resample.o has been integrated and removed)

- integer*8 support; ratty flag to go back to the old situation if
  the fortran compiler does not support integer*8
  [this will support scratchfiles > 8GB]

- write out proper long integers in itemize
  question is how fortran can do this?

- a conversion routine from MIR4 to MIR3 format (int8 -> int) if possible
  this program/script should check if all the int8 variables are short
  enough that they can be cut into an int4:
	nwcorr
	ncorr
	vislen	(points to visdata, which does not need to be changed)
	
	? flags		?? could this ever be > 2GB ???
	? wflags

- programs that read ascii files, tables and such should *as a rule*
  skip lines that start with the (universal unix) comment symbol (#)

- mir-config that can spit out the cflags, libs etc...
  for example , in the current release uvio  is not linked with LFS,
  unlike the rest. so uvio will hang....

- use scropen8,scrclose8,scread8,scrwrite8 in addition to scropen stuff
  since we 

- design a fftw interface to miriad's fft routines - should give an impressive
  speedup on intel hardware


- miriad name collisions:
	solaris:/usr/ucb/implot

- pgplot:  gfortran cannot compile the GIF drivers
