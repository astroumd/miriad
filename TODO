- integer*8 support; ratty flag to go back to the old situation if
  the fortran compiler does not support integer*8
  [this will support scratchfiles > 8GB]

- write out proper long integers in itemize

- a conversion routine from MIR4 to MIR3 format (int8 -> int) if possible
  this program/script should check if all the int8 variables are short
  enough that they can be cut into an int4:
	nwcorr
	ncorr
	vislen	(points to visdata, which does not need to be changed)
	
	? flags		?? could this ever be > 2GB ???
	? wflags

- programs that read ascii files, tables and such should *as a rule*
  skip lines that start with the (universal unix) comment symbol (#)

- mir-config that can spit out the cflags, libs etc...
  for example , in the current release uvio  is not linked with LFS,
  unlike the rest. so uvio will hang....
