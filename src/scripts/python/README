Title:Explanation on the SWIG bindings via uvio.i :
Author:	(WSRT group)

To compile the python utilities which bind
to the Miriad library, we need a clean
Miriad library, consisting only of the 
C-routines. This library is known as
libmirc.so / libmirc.a

It can be produced as follows:
in $MIRLIB run
 $CC -I$MIRINC -c *.c
 ar cr libmirc.a *.o
 ld -shared -o libmirc.so --whole-archive libmirc.a

The standard Miriad library libmir.so / libmir.a
has too many dependencies (pgplot, f2c, etc.)
to be useful.

See also the $MIR/install/mirlib.export file
for an example how to generate one of those.

The *.i files for SWIG explain how to build
the python bindings.
