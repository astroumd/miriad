#+
#  MIRMAKE is a script that uses the build configuration of
#  your MIRIAD installation to compile a task whose Fortran
#  source is located in the current directory.
#
#  If you are using the task UVFIT, for instance, and decide
#  that you wish to customize it, you could do the following:
#
#    cp $MIRPROG/vis/uvfit.* .
#    mirmake uvfit
#    ./uvfit vis=....
#
#  (Note that many tasks have corresponding .h files that will
#  also need to be copied into the current directory for them
#  to compile successfully.)
#
#  MIRMAKE invokes the standard Unix tool 'make' with a 
#  Makefile generated when MIRIAD was compiled.
#
#  Inputs:
#    P1 Base name of the task to compile (e.g., 'uvcal')
#
#  Outputs:
#    An executable file named P1
#--
#  History:
#    pkgw 31jul07  Initial version.
