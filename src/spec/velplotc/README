This software is a modified version of velplot, written by Chin Fei Lee.

It works with the XForms library (http://world.std.com/~xforms/), which
you need to install before you can install this package.

Binaries for most architectures are available through that web page or from
http://world.std.com/~xforms/ftp/ftp.html
