This software is a modified version of velplot, written by Chin Fei Lee.

It works with the XForms library (http://world.std.com/~xforms/), which
you need to install before you can install this package.

Binaries for most architectures are available through that web page or from
http://world.std.com/~xforms/ftp/ftp.html

Here's a recent example on Fedora-11, which comes with xforms version
"1.0.90-12.fc11", e.g.
	yum install xforms-devel
will install this.
Note the comments in Makefile about using g77 vs. gfortran.
