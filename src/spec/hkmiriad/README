These are Jin Koda's miriad routines.

See also http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~koda/hkmiriad/

They need the small ZENO library, which takes care of the
user interface. You can find this in $MIR/borrow/zeno, and
you should be able to issue:
	make install_miriad
to get it installed (it need libZeno.a in $MIRLIB)

The installation of the tools here is still a little shaky.
Use the supplies Makefile.hk, copy it to Makefile and try
and work with it. It is possible you need to modify the
variuous LIBS and flags at the top a bit.




Portability issues:
-------------------


* some of the code are translations of corresponding fortran routines,
  this is not marked where they are from, and therefore fixes/updates
  in those are not easily tracked here

* the baseline <-> antennae pair ("256*a1+a2") is hardcoded!!! also
  for the baseline an 'unsigned short' is used.
  1) MAXIANT in maxdim.h allows to use large arrays where bl > 65k
  2) 'short int' is 16 bits, and will only count to 65k and handles
     array up to 256 ants.
  There is example code in uvio.c that handles different MAXIANT (256
  in this case is hardcoded), but there may be some issue where CARMA
  and ATNF versions of miriad differ:  caution!
  
* installation issues:
  the FLIBS= macro can be stolen from the $MIR/install/Makefile one,
  that usually will fix it if the current default (-lg2c for the g77
  compiler) does not work.  See also wiki for updates
