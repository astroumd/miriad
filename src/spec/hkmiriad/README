These are Jin Koda's miriad routines.

They need the small ZENO library, which takes care of the
user interface. You can find this in $MIR/borrow/zeno, and
you should be able to issue:
	make install_miriad
to get it installed (it need libZeno.a in $MIRLIB)

The installation of the tools here is still a little shaky.
Use the supplies Makefile.hk, copy it to Makefile and try
and work with it. It is possible you need to modify the
variuous LIBS and flags at the top a bit.
