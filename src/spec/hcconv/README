This code was in use in the early days of BIMA, when data 
was still produced on the VAX, and had to be converted
to miriad format. It is horribly non-portable, and is unlikely
to still compile or even of any  interest. 

This version ran on sunos (before it was even called solaris).
There is also a VMS version, called uvhat, to which similar comments apply.

For historic reasons we still keep the code in MIRIAD (history repeats)
