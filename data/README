This directory will be mostly empty when you receive miriad, but
is meant to contain the MIRIAD standard datasets from a variety
of telescopes that work with MIRIAD. These datasets are needed
for certain benchmarks, and confirm the correct workings of MIRIAD
for those telescope data. Some scripts (e.g mir.flux and mir.fringe)
will deposit data in this directory.

You can also hunt for them in the following general location:

        ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/pub/carma/data
