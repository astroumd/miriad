This directory will be mostly empty when you receive miriad, but
is meant to contain the MIRIAD standard datasets from a variety
of telescopes that work with MIRIAD. These datasets are needed
for certain benchmarks, and confirm the correct workings of MIRIAD
for those telescope data.

It will be the responsibility of these sites to provide URL's 
where these datasets can be downloaded from. Ideally a tar file
or fits file, e.g.

	wget http://bima.astro.umd.edu/miriad/data/bima1.tar
	tar zf bima1.tar

or
	wget http://bima.astro.umd.edu/miriad/data/bima2.fits
	fits in=bima2.fits out=bima2.uv op=uvin
