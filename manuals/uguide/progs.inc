% Appendix: functional and alphabetical listing of all Miriad programs
%
\mylabel{a:progs}
\myfile{progs.inc}

This Appendix lists all programs that are available if MIRIAD is
fully installed. It contains two lists of all programs, one sorted by
functional category, and one sorted alphabetically. The names
of the responsible programmers are listed too, in case you would
like to discuss bugs, suggestions for improvements etc. Keep in mind that
both lists are automatically generated by the {\tt doc} program\index{doc}
from the actual source code,
and hence can easily get out of data when new programs have been
added. You can also check directories {\bf \$MIRBIN} and {\bf \$MIRPDOC} 
\index{MIRBIN, environment} \index{MIRPDOC, environment}
to see what is actually available.
\index{environment, MIRBIN} \index{environment, MIRPDOC}
