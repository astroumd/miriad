\section{Future}

As we get to know CARMA and refine calibration strategies,
a number of new techniques will undoubtedly
will have to be addressed. We name a few that are appearing 
on the horizon that you can expect future versions of the cookbook to address:

\begin{itemize}
\item 
Polarization
\item 
Blanking and Flagging: baseline and band dependant integration times. This will
require some changes to the lower level Miriad code.
\item 
More detailed primary beam models for OVRO and BIMA for improved mosaicing. Currently
only simple gaussians are used. Again something needed in Miriad.
\item 
Iterative Selfcal (cf. BIMA Song scripts)
\end{itemize}
