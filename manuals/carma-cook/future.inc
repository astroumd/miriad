\section{Future}

As we get to know CARMA and refine calibration strategies,
a number of new techniques will undoubtedly
will have to be addressed. We name a few that are appearing 
on the horizon that you can expect future versions of the cookbook to address:

\begin{itemize}
\item 1
Polarization
\item 2
Blanking and Flagging: baseline and band dependant integration times. This will
require some changes to the lower level Miriad code.
\item 3
More detailed primary beam models for OVRO and BIMA for improved mosaicing. Currently
only simple gaussians are used. Again something needed in Miriad.
\item 4
Iterative Selfcal (cf. BIMA Song scripts)
\end{itemize}
