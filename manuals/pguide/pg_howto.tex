The MIRIAD Programmer's Guide contains information useful to
MIRIAD programmers.  The sole purpose of this manual is to serve
as a reference book for use in writing MIRIAD programs.

\par Chapter 2 discusses general conventions for MIRIAD programming.
Chapter 3 lists the subroutines needed for user specification of MIRIAD
parameters.  Chapter 4 discusses internal code documentation, including
the writing of the on-line documentation available to MIRIAD users.
Chapter 5 gives information on utility programs that are useful to MIRIAD
programmers.  Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9 provide information on MIRIAD datasets.
Chapter 10 gives information on several topics of general interest to MIRIAD
programmers.  The appendices list MIRIAD image items, uv variables, a list of
