MIRIAD programmers have to set up their accounts on the machines they will
be using, just like regular MIRIAD users.

\beginsection{Berkeley Sun4}

To get the definitions needed to run MIRIAD, include the following at the
end of your {\tt \~\//.cshrc} file:
{\ninepoint\begintt
    setenv MIR ~mirth
    source $MIR/MIRRC
    set path = ($MIRBIN $path)
\endtt}
Once you have done this, enter ``{\tt source \~\//.cshrc}'', and you will be
set up for the current working session.  You will be set up automatically
at login thereafter.

\beginsection{RALINT Users on Berkeley VAX (VMS)}

There are name conflicts between some RALINT and MIRIAD tasks.  By default,
RALINT users initially have the RALINT set-up (this is handled by the normal
RALINT login command procedure).  To get MIRIAD definitions, give the command
{\ninepoint\begintt
    $ miriad
\endtt}
To switch back to RALINT definitions, use
{\ninepoint\begintt
    $ ralint
\endtt}

\beginsection{Illinois Sun4}

To get the definitions needed to run MIRIAD, include the following in your
{\tt \~\//.cshrc} file, anywhere after your {\tt path} has been set (note the
backquotes around {\tt arch}):
{\ninepoint\begintt
    if (`arch` == "sun4" && -e ~miriad/cshrc.nMIRIAD) then
       source ~miriad/cshrc.nMIRIAD
    end
\endtt}
Once you have done this, enter ``{\tt source \~\//.cshrc}'', and you will be
set up for the current working session.  You will be set up automatically
at login thereafter.  This procedure sets MIRIAD's environment variables
and includes MIRIAD's binary directory \$MIRBIN in your searchpath, placing
it after your ``.'' directory if you have one, and first otherwise.

\beginsection{Maryland Sun3 and Sun4}

To get the definitions needed to run MIRIAD, include the following at the
end of your {\tt \~\//.cshrc} file:
{\ninepoint\begintt
    setenv MIR ~mirth
    source $MIR/MIRRC
    set path = ($MIRBIN $path)
\endtt}
Once you have done this, enter {\tt source \~\//.cshrc}, and you will be
set up for the current working session.  You will be set up automatically
at login thereafter.

\beginsection{NCSA Cray2}

Ensure that directory {\tt /usr/bin/X11} is in your searchpath.

To get the definitions needed to run MIRIAD, include the following in your
{\tt \~\//.cshrc} file, anywhere after your {\tt path} has been set:
{\ninepoint\begintt
    if (-e ~u11329/cshrc.nMIRIAD) then
       source ~u11329/cshrc.nMIRIAD
    end
\endtt}
Once you have done this, enter ``{\tt source \~\//.cshrc}'', and you will be
set up for the current working session.  You will be set up automatically
at login thereafter.  This procedure sets MIRIAD's environment variables
and includes MIRIAD's binary directory \$MIRBIN in your searchpath, placing
it after your ``.'' directory if you have one, and first otherwise.

\beginsection{NCSA Convex}

To get the definitions needed to run MIRIAD, include the following in your
{\tt \~\//.cshrc} file, anywhere after your {\tt path} has been set:
{\ninepoint\begintt
    if (-e ~u11329/cshrc.nMIRIAD) then
       source ~u11329/cshrc.nMIRIAD
    end
\endtt}
Once you have done this, enter ``{\tt source \~\//.cshrc}'', and you will be
set up for the current working session.  You will be set up automatically
at login thereafter.  This procedure sets MIRIAD's environment variables
and includes MIRIAD's binary directory \$MIRBIN in your searchpath, placing
it after your ``.'' directory if you have one, and first otherwise.
