This directory contains a historic record of all the best fitted
(using a set of quasars accross the sky) baseline positions in
the various configurations of CARMA from May 2007 onwards.
The first 3 columns are the equatorial X,Y,Z positions (in nanosec)
of the antennae. By convention, ants 1-6 are the OVRO dishes,
7-15 the BIMA dishes, and 16-23 the SZA dishes for later data.

You can also generate simulated data using UVGEN, with the following
important settings:

   uvgen ant=antpos.YYMMDD baseunit=1


Given the appropriate antpos file, CARMA data should be corrected as
follows:

   uvedit vis=xxx.mir out=yyy.mir apfile=antpos.YYMMDD

It is safe to apply these (absolute) corrections again. In doubt,
check the xxx.mir/history file.
