<h2>Applying Baseline</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Baseline correction:
    <ul>
      <li> Do a miriad cvs update to your source tree. This way, you
will have the latest baseline solutions in
$MIRCAT/baselines/carma/antpos.YYMMDD file.
        <pre>         cd $MIR ; cvs -nq update ; cvs update<br>      </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Alternately,
    <ul>
      <li> Find the date your data were taken, and download a baseline
solution from the list below. </li>
      <li> Apply the solution "antpos.YYMMDD" to the data "xxx.mir",
and obtain the corrected data "yyy.mir".
        <pre>         uvedit vis=xxx.mir apfile=antpos.YYMMDD out=yyy.mir<br>      </pre>
      </li>
      <li> It's safe to apply baseline correction if you don't know
what solution has been applied to your data. </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Axis offset correction:
    <ul>
      <li> Early tracks (before Jan 5, 2007) need axis offset
correction (don't forget @).
        <pre>         axcor vis=yyy.miriad axoff=@axoff.xxx out=zzz.miriad<br></pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

relative to C8.
C1, C5, C11 and C15 have significant offsets from the previous value;
curiously all 0.01 ns in the x-direction. The PACS SZA antennas C17,
C18, C21, C2 and C23 had a roughly constant offset in x, y and z of
-0.15,+0.14,-0.01 ns respectively. C22 had data for less than 2 hours,
so solutions are based on few sources (but reasonable HA and Dec.
coverage). <br>
Steps:<br>
1. Derive solutions for C1,C2,C5,C10 relative to C8 using bee 4-P fit<br>
2. use this group to derive solutions individually for all other sci1
and sci2 antennas<br>
3. sci2 antenna solutions derived using step2 followed several
iterations of phase difference and 4-P.<br>
4. using win(9) only in 4-P fit for sci2 antennas reduced the phase
noise considerably.<br>
