Bob Sault (while at UIUC around 1988-1990) is the main architect of
MIRIAD, largely based on his earlier design of the WERONG system (his
thesis work at ATNF).

Many programmers contributed to MIRIAD, usually the source code refers
to 2 or 3 letter acronyms of their contributions. You can find a lookup
table of who they are in the file $MIR/cat/miriad.pgmrs.
