Notes on what was done to miriad for the MIR5 transition:

   NOTE:: this revision will remain on a branch until deemed stable,
   after which the main trunk will become a MIR4 branch, and
   MIR5 will become the trunk.

- uvio.c and needed friends from the ATNF distribution will be merged
  in with the CARMA version.
