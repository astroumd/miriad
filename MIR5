Notes on what was done to miriad for the MIR5 transition:

   NOTE:: this revision will remain on a branch until deemed stable,
   after which the main trunk will become a MIR4 branch, and
   MIR5 will eventually become the trunk once this branch has been deemed
	production.

   The following CVS commands were used to branch:

	cvs rtag mir_4_0_4	
	cvs rtag -b MIR5
	<VERSION files modified to 4.0.5 in the main trunk>
	<VERSION files modified to 5.0.0 in the MIR5 branch>

status and work done on the merge:
==================================

MIRSUBS C-routines:

interface.c		minor merge - DONE
bug.c			some work needed, nothing showstopping (remove VMS?) [atnf has older code mostly]
dirs.c			VMS only, keep it??
headio.c		major work -- THIS IS WHERE the INT4/INT8 work is performed - DONE
hio.c			minor work - DONE
key.c			ATNF uses keyc.c !! work needed, but works 'as is'
maskio.c		minor work needed - DONE
scrio.c			minor work (int vs. off_t/size_t) - DONE
xyio.c			minor work (added xydim) - DONE
xyzio.c			minor work (added xyzdim) - DONE
uvio.c			the ATNF version was taken, CARMA things merged in. - DONE

iface.f2c		new from ATNF - DONE
mm.f2c			straight from ATNF - DONE
packwrap.f2c		straight from ATNF - DONE
tcpio.f2c		straight from ATNF - DONE
wrap.f2c		straight from ATNF - DONE
xyziowrap.f2c		straight from ATNF - DONE



TOOLS:

intf2c.c		deals with the fortran integer/logical issues - DONE
flint.c			minor merge - DONE
ratty.c			minor merge - DONE
doc_atnf.c		simple update (we have our own dogged doc.c) - DONE


MIRSUBS FOR-routines:
  we have 141 .for files, atnf has 121 files, all but 1 are extra in 'us'
  but note atnf also stores them in architecture specific subdirectories

keyf.for		ATNF has key.for (see key.c and keyc.c notes)

uvdat.for		notice some merging needed
