Notes on what was done to miriad for the MIR5 transition:

   NOTE:: this revision will remain on a branch until deemed stable,
   after which the main trunk will become a MIR4 branch, and
   MIR5 will eventually become the trunk once this branch has been deemed
	production.

   The following CVS commands were used to branch:

	cvs rtag mir_4_0_4	
	cvs rtag -b MIR5
	<VERSION files modified to 4.0.5 in the main trunk>
	<VERSION files modified to 5.0.0 in the MIR5 branch>
