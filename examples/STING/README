This is an example from the STING survey (Bolatto et al.). The example here
is a single mosaicing track for M99 (NGC4254) also used in a comparison
study in 2010 to compare reducing CARMA data through MIRIAD and CASA. This
is still ongoing and not published yet.  More info here in due time

After running get_data, proceed and run the M99 script.

spitzer2miriad.csh is an example of the kinds of things to do (and watch
out for) if you convert spitzer/IRAC data to miriad
