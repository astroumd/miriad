# REGRID using an axis description

  First we create an image with a heavily oversampled non-circular gauss
  Note that regrid is now using Hours and Degrees
  map1 has 0.25" pixels, map2 has 1.0" pixels

imgen out=map1 cell=0.25 imsize=256 radec=0,30 spar=1,0,0,10,5,0
regrid in=map1 out=map2 desc=0,31,.00027777,64,30,31,.00027777,64 axes=1,2

# REGRID using a simple rotation

  note as is, this doesn't put in the right WCS, so map3 has a bad WCS
  maybe it needs more keywords

regrid in=map1 out=map3 rotate=30

# REGRID using a template
