This directory contains the source code examples that were used in the 
tutorial.  The Makefile provided should build the examples correctly as
long as the following line is changed:

DTM = /usr/local/netdev

replace the path with the path which locates your include files and library.
If they are installed in standard locations (/usr/include and /usr/lib)
then these macros are not needed.


All of the examples in this directory were written using ANSI C.  This is
a problem for the default Sun compilers which still only recognize K&R.
gcc, the GNU C compiler, should compile this code correctly.  If gcc isn't
available on your system, or any other ANSI compliant C compiler, then
the function definitions can be changed by hand to the old style K&R
declarations.  To do this, for example, change:

                  static int readMSG(int inport)
to
                  static int readMSG(inport)
                  int inport;

This should clean up any of the problems.  If not, well, get an ANSI compliant
compiler!  8-)


These example codes have been compiled and tested on the following machines:
     SGI - IRIX 4.0.5
     Sun Sparcstation IPC & Sun4
     Cray Y-MP
     Convex 3880
     IBM RS6000
