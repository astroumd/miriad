.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B RISsetTitle
inserts the 
.B DTM
title tag followed by the null-terminated character
string 
.I title
into the header.  The title is surrounded by single quotation
marks so that it's contents will not affect the interpretation of the header.
.LP
.B RISgetTitle
examines the string
.I header 
and determines the title string that it contains.  Memory for the 
.I title
string must be allocated by the 
user before attempting to extract the title from the header.  If there is 
insufficient memory allocated to store the entire title as contained in the 
header, the title string is truncated.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.B RISgetTitle
returns the error 
.B DTMERROR
if the 
.B DTM 
title tag is not contained
within the header, or if following the tag there is no delimited title string.
Otherwise, 
.B RISgetTitle
returns a 0 value.
.LP
.SH "BUGS"
.B RISsetTitle
has no way of determining if the header contains sufficient space to hold the 
.B DTM 
title tag and the title string itself.  The results of
attempting to store this information beyond the end of the allocated space
are undefined.
