In July 2010 the coordinate routines in $MIRSUBS/co.for have
obtained a dependance on the WCS library the ATNF distributes
with their version of miriad.
If you have this version you will need to integrate this
library:
    after the usual configure (e.g. --prefix=$MIR/opt)
    copy the lib/* files to $MIRLIB
    copy the include/* directory to $MIRINC
    add -lwcs to link line
