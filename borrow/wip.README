if you don't see a directory 'wip' here, it probably means you
did not get a proper BIMA version of miriad. Most likely you
used cvs, and need to plant the wip tree here:
	cd $MIR/borrow 		(which is here)
	cvs checkout wip	plant the wip tree
	mirboss			become miriad boss
	mir.install wip		compile wip
