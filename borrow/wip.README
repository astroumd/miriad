if you don't see a directory 'wip' here, it probably means you
did not get a proper BIMA version of miriad. Most likely you
used CVS, and need to plant the wip tree here (in CVS terms:
wip is a separate module under CVS)

The following commands should install wip:

	cd $MIR/borrow 		You need to have miriad loaded
	cvs checkout wip	plant the wip tree
	mirboss			become miriad boss
	mir.install wip		compile wip
