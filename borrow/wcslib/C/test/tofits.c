* tofits turns a list of FITS header keyrecords, one per line, into a proper
* FITS header by padding them with blanks to 80 characters and stripping out
* newline characters.  It also pads the header to an integral number of 2880-
* byte blocks if necessary.
*
* It operates as a filter, e.g.:
*
*     tofits < infile > outfile
*
* Input lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments.
