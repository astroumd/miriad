tkrun is a small C program that turns your annotated scripts into
a GUI, to more easily and quickly control a few keyword=value
parameters.
Although you can obtain it via NEMO, you can also manually add 
this to MIRIAD as follows, using CVS. 

If you don't see the $MIR/borrow/tkrun directory, do the following
to get the source, and install this program.


     cvs co  -d tkrun nemo/src/tools/tkrun
     cd tkrun
     make tkrun
     mv tkrun $MIRBIN
     rehash
