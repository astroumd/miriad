tkrun is a small C program that turns your annotated scripts into
a GUI, to more easily and quickly control a few keyword=value
parameters.
Although you can obtain it via NEMO, you can also manually add 
this to MIRIAD as follows, using CVS.

To get the source, and install, do the following:



     cvs co  -d tkrun nemo/src/tools/tkrun
     cd tkrun
     make tkrun
     mv tkrun $MIRBIN
     rehash
