if you don't see a directory 'nemo' here, it probably means you did not
get this added package for miriad. If you used CVS, and need to plant
the nemo tree here (in CVS terms: nemo is a separate module under CVS)

If miriad has been installed, the following commands should install wip:

	cd $MIR/borrow 		You need to have miriad loaded
	cvs checkout nemo	plant the wip tree
	mirboss			become miriad boss
	mir.install nemo	compile nemo

check out the logfile in $MIR/tmp for any errors.
