These are changes made in Release3.10r2

*	fixed bug in DFSDIgetslice

*	reduced overhead of checking in DFSDIgetslice by adding DFIseek
	and DFIread which does not do the redundant checking

*	added MIPSEL machine type for DEC 3100 and DEC 5000

*	fixed inconsistency in dfivms.h

------------------------------

These are changes made in Release3.10

*	fixed bug concerning checking the status of opening a file
	with unbuffered i/o

*	Added function DF24readref and DFGRreadref for random access
	of 24-bit rasters

*	Added function DF24restart

*	Added function DF24setil

*	Speed up the DFSDgetdata, DFSDputdata, DFSDadddata,
	DFSDgetslice and DFSDputslice functions, especially for UNICOS
	machines

*	Added functions DFANaddfid, DFABaddfds, DFANgetfidlen,
	DFANgetfid, DFANgetdslen, DFANgetfds, DFANaddfann,
	DFANgetfannlen, DFANgetfann and DFANlastref.

*	Revised DFANlablist so that it returns all ref numbers for a
	given tag

*	Fixed bug with DFSDgetdata where it does not move to the next
	SDG

*	Added some macros to make passing character arrays from
	fortran to C easier

*	Fixed some more minor bugs

*	Recoded some parts for cosmetic reasons

--------------
New features of HDF 3.0 include the following:

Fortran support for Macintosh II, for Language System Fortran and MPW C
3.0.

An interface for basic i/o of 24-bit raster images, which includes the 
following routines:

  DF24addimage:appends a 24-bit raster image set to the file.

  DF24getdims: retrieves the dimensions and interlace of the
               image.

  DF24getimage: retrieves the image and stores it in an array.

  DF24reqil:   specifies an interlace to be used in place of the
               interlace indicated in the file when the next raster
               image is read.


An interface for annotating HDF data objects and files, which includes 
the following routines:

  DFANgetlablen: gets length of label of a tag/ref
  
  DFANgetlabel:  gets label of tag/ref

  DFANgetdesclen: gets length of description of tag/ref

  DFANgetdesc:   gets description of tag/ref

  DFANputlabel:  puts label of tag/ref

  DFANputdesc:   puts description of tag/ref

  DFANlastref:   returns ref of last annotation read or written

  DFANlablist:   gets list of labels for a particular tag


An interface for input and output of 8-bit palettes, including the 
following routines:

  DFPaddpal:    appends a palette to a file.

  DFPgetpal:    reads in the next palette in the file.

  DFPputpal:    writes a palette to a file.

  DFPnpals:     indicates number of palettes in a file.

  DFPwriteref:  sets the reference number of the next palette to be
                written.

  DFPreadref:   gets the reference number of the next palette to be
                retrieved.

  DFPrestart:   specifies that the next call to DFPgetpal reads the
                first palette in the file, rather than the next.

  DFPlastref:   returns the value of the reference number most recently
                read or written.



Scientific data set routines for storing and retreiving subsets (slices) 
of scientific data, and for choosing optional storage formats and data 
types:

  DFSDstartslice: prepares system to write part of a dataset to a file.

  DFSDputslice:   writes part of a dataset to a file.

  DFSDendslice:   indicates write completion for part of a dataset.

  DFSDgetslice:   reads part of a dataset.

  DFSDsettype:    specifies data attributes: data type and 
                  representation, system type, and array order.


* new utilities, including the following:

  hdfed:    lets you browse in an HDF file and manipulate some of the
            data

  fptohdf:  converts floating point data to HDF floating point data
            and/or 8-bit raster images

  r24tohdf: converts a raw RGB 24-bit image to an 8-bit RIS8 with a
            palette

  paltohdf: converts a raw palette to hdf format

  hdftopal: converts palette in an hdf file to raw format
