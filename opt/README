Sometimes MIRIAD needs some 3rd party library or code.  You can either
borrow them from your system, or if you don't have them, or want to
use another version, you can install them using the familiar

	  configure --prefix=$MIR/opt
	  make
	  make install

procedure, by using $MIR/opt as the prefix.
