As of version 3.1.0 the classic parameters MAXDIM, MAXANT and MAXBASE have been abused
in two, or even 3-dimensional arrays.

The problem is that with static memory allocation (which MIRIAD mostly uses), 
large arrya

Also, some DATA statements were used based on some large arrays (e.g. MAXBASE) and produced
extremely large executable sizes,and hence large times to load the executables in e.g.
an network disk (NFS) based environment.  These have all been replaced by
initializers

	call qarrset(n, qarr, qval)
	call iarrset(n, qarr, qval)
	call rarrset(n, qarr, qval)
	call darrset(n, qarr, qval)
