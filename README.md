#  MIRIAD

MIRIAD (the Multichannel ....) was originally developed for BIMA, and
has been adopted for a number of radio telescopes (CARMA, SMA, WSRT,
ATNF and perhaps more).  Sadly each of these has clones and diverged
from the original version of MIRIAD.  So be it.  This is the original
BIMA/CARMA version, as originally developed by Bob Sault in the late
80s. 



# Installation

We have a csh script **install_miriad** and a much simpler bare bones
